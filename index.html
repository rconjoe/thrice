        <h2> How did we get here?</h2>
        <p>
          Three.js enables lame developers like me, limping along on my JavaScript crutches, to claim I can make stunning 3D animations like the ones you see here.
        </p>

        <p>
          Do you want to make models, textures, scenes, and geometry too? Well then, my friend, your're one simple npm install away from deepening that increasing feeling of impostor syndrome!
        </p>

        <p>
          Will having impressive animations on your personal website get you job interviews? Probably! Will it make you sound like any less of a dunce in interviews? Probably not!
